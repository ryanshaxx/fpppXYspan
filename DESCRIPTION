Description: A smooth curve can be displayed graphically as a phase-plane plot
    (velocity verse acceleration). A phase-plane plot is a graphical
    representation of the energy of the system. The X-axis represents
    kinetic energy and the Y-axis the potential energy of the system.  See
    Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) <https://doi.org/10.1002/0470013192.bsa239> 
    and in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-98185-7>
    for further details. The function in this package dynamically extracts
    the X-axis and Y-axis span, the total kinetic energy and potential
    energy, respectively in the system. These quantities can give valuable
    insights into the behavior of the system. This function caters for the
    evaluation period to which the functional data object is subjected to
    and caters for multiple smooth curves (inferring multiple phase-plane
    plots) within the functional data object variable. Upon calling this
    function, the phase-plane plot or plots of the functional data object
    will be generated and a data frame contain a summary of the X-axis and
    Y-axis spans. It should be used in conjunction with the functions provided 
    by the 'fda' package.
